# n3xpl0rer

## What's this?

n3xpl0rer is a simple tool designed to automate reconnaissance tasks during penetration tests or security assessments.

The idea behind this project is to allow users to create custom workflows, which n3xpl0rer will execute automatically to streamline the recon process. By defining steps in a workflow, you can speed up your reconnaissance efforts without manually running each tool.
